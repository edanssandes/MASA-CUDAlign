	                     MASA-Core library

MASA (Multi-Platform Architecture for Sequence Aligners) is a software architecture 
that simplifies the implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm with Affine 
Gap penalties in any software/hardware architecture. 

MASA is divided in two parts: the "MASA Core", containing all the portable 
code; and the "MASA Extension", that contains the non-portable code. In order 
to create a new MASA extension, the non-portable part of the code must be 
reimplemented while the portable code must be kept untouched. The MASA 
architecture uses an oriented object paradigm to make the non-portable code 
low dependent of the portable code. This loosely coupled architecture produces 
an easier integration between the non-portable code and the portable code.

===========
Compilation
===========

     $ ./configure 
     $ make
     
This will generate the 'libmasa.a' static library.


===========
Documentation
===========

To implement a new MASA extension, read the Doxygen directory. You will find 
basic instructions about the the MASA architecture and the class documentation.

     $ cd doxygen
     $ doxygen masa-core.doxyfile
     $ chromium-browser index.html
