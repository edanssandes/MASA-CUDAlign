====================
1.4.2.1028
====================

* This version was created for checkpointing all the previous changes related to 
   multi-GPU execution, stage 4 optimizations and other bugfixes. Sorry if it 
   hasn't been documented properly in the last years.
   
   
====================
Version 4.0.0.1019
====================

* Created this version for checkpointing all the previous changes related to 
   multi-GPU execution.



====================
Version 3.0.1.1008
====================

- libMasa changes:
 * Improvements in the multigpu support (--fork parameter).
 * Sanity check in the command line parameters for forked processes. For
	example, with the --fork parameter, only stage-1 is allowed and 
	flushing rows is disabled.
	
- CUDAlign changes:  
 * Feature ENORMOUS_ALIGNMENT was implemented to allow alignment of sequences
	longer than 134MBP, with a performance penalty of 10%. This feature
	removes the read-only texture cache from all the data structures. To enable
	this feature, use ./configure --enable-enormous-alignments.


====================
Version 3.0.1.1009
====================

- libMasa changes:
 * Better error handling when the fasta file does not exists

- CUDAlign changes:
 * Removed bug in the sequence size check for ENORMOUS_ALIGNMENT.
 * Better statistics information produced by the CUDAlign
 * Changes in the automatic block assignment for each GPU.
 * Unsupported GPUs are not assigned to a valid GPU ID.
 
====================
Version 3.0.1.1010
====================

- libMasa changes:
 * Removed BUG in the circular Buffer. When the output buffer was not empty,
    the destruct method enters in deadlock. Furthermore, there were some
    procedures that did not acquired the mutex lock, what leads to a
    possible deadlock due a race condition.
 

====================
Version 3.0.1.1011
====================

- libMasa changes:
 * The --split parameter was divided in --split and --part parameters
 * The --split parameters can be used together with the --fork parameter.
 * The syntax of parameters --split and --fork was changed from A/B/C to A,B,C.
 * A better argument error check was implemented for --split and --fork.
 * Statistics methods (blocking time, usage, etc) in the circular Buffers.
 * Removed BUG in file Buffer. There was a SEGFAULT error when a file Buffer 
    was terminated.
 * Better error messages in SpecialRowWriter.
 * Stderr statistics are logged in a frequency of 5.0s instead of 2.0s.

====================
Version 3.0.1.1012
====================

- libMasa changes:
 * A better argument error check when using single integer parameter 
    was implemented for --split and --fork. This avoids the usage of wrong
    characters in these parameters.
 * Fine tuning of the log interval in circular Buffers.

====================
Version 3.0.1.1013
==================== 

- libMasa changes:
 * Removed BUG in stage4. When the half partition was computed with orthogonal
    execution, the orthogonal size of the half partition could not be larger
    than the vector size. This check was not made, leading to a SIGSEGV error.
 * The first read/write operation in the circular buffers is now being logged. 
 * The maximum size of the buffer is printed in the beginning of the log.
 * Removed BUG that prints wrong values when the buffer delta is negative.
 * Stderr statistics are logged in a frequency of 10.0s instead of 5.0s.
 
====================
Version 3.0.1.1014
==================== 

- libMasa changes:
 * Removed BUG that print wrong information in the statistics file. The problem
    is that the ENORMOUS ALIGNMENT was always printed as FALSE, even when it
    was enabled with the --enable-enormous-alignment.
 * Created Null Buffer for benchmark purposes.
 * Removed BUG that wrongly reads the E-component of the first column.
 
====================
Version 3.0.1.1015
==================== 

- libMasa changes:
 * Removed stage-3 BUG that do not consider full gap partitions finishing in
    H-component.
 * Implemented unit tests for aligners.
 * Special rows in the last partition of stage 2 were totally flushed, leading
    to a very big partition that could not be aligned in stage 4.
 
 
====================
Version 3.0.2.1016
==================== 

- libMasa changes:
 * IAligner has a new alignPartition method, instead of the
    prepare/processNextIteration methods.
 * There is no setProcessSpecialRowFunction anymore. Now, we call the 
    setSpecialRowWriter function instead.
 * Removed several BUGs in the semi-global alignments.
 * Created some safe-thread methods and classes to be used by the aligner. 
 * The Log procedure is done in a separate thread.
 
- CUDAlign changes:
 * Removed BUG that wrongly dispatches the last cell.
 * Changed code to support the new MASA interface.   
 
 
====================
Version 3.0.2.1017
==================== 

- libMasa changes:
 * ChearN option converts uppercase "N" to lower case "n" in one of the sequences.
    This avoids matching N's without removing them.
 * Git migration
 * Project Splitting
 * Many bugfixes was correted in the Buffers
 * Generic BlockPruning class
 
====================
Version 3.0.2.1017
==================== 

- libMasa changes:
 * Recursive Stage 3
 * Partition rows are now saved in specific directories
 * Refactoring of the sw_stage source codes
