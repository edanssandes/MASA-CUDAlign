	                     MASA-CUDAlign extension
	                 
What is it?
===========

The MASA-CUDAlign extension is used with the MASA architecture to align DNA 
sequences of unrestricted size with the Smith-Waterman algorithm combined 
with Myers-Miller. It uses the NVIDIA CUDA platform for accelerating 
the computation time. 

This project is published under the GPLv3 License.
